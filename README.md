# PHP linked list example

This is a simple example of a linked list in PHP. It is not intended to be used in production, but rather to demonstrate 
the concept of a linked list. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a group of nodes which together represent
a sequence. Since arrays exist in PHP, there is no need to implement a linked list in PHP. However, for example in the C
programming language, linked lists are useful because arrays are not built in.

The major difference between an array and a linked list is their structure. An array is an index based data structure 
where each element associated with an index. On the other hand, a linked list relies on references where each node consists
of the data and the references to the previous and next element.
